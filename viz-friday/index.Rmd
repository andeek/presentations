# Interactive Statistical Graphics

class: middle

> [Data analysis] must be considered as an open-ended, highly interactive, iterative process, whose actual steps are segments of a stubbily branching, tree-like pattern of possible actions

# Example Applications

# CommuniD3

Authors: Andee Kaplan, Eric Hare

https://github.com/gammarama/DataExpo2013  
https://andeek.shinyapps.io/CommuniD3/

Exploratory tool based on 'Soul of the Community' data generated by the Knight Foundation in cooperation with Gallup

Project was created as part of the 2013 Data Exposition

Goal is to facilitate the understanding of why people feel attachment to their communities

Point of view of a community planner, either from one of the communities in the study or from a community in the same region or a similar urbanicity

By exploring the factors that lead to community attachment in a similar community to their own, a user can apply the conclusions to their own situation

**Interactive elements:** Filtering, linked plots, hover text

# gravicom

Authors: Andee Kaplan, Heike Hofmann, Dan Nordman

https://github.com/andeek/gravicom  
https://andeek.shinyapps.io/gravicom/

A community in a graph is defined as a group of nodes that share properties, often seen as a collection of nodes which are densely linked to nodes within the community and sparsely linked to notes outside

Search for an optimal partition based on an objective function is typically an NP-hard problem, as the number of possible partitions of the network requires $2^n$ complexity

Communities are often fuzzily-defined human concepts $\Rightarrow$ add element of human judgement
through an interactive visualization-based community detection tool

**Interactive elements:** Graph simplification through use of motifs, interactive updating of summary statistics, "shake" the layout

# protoshiny

Authors: Andee Kaplan, Jacob Bien

https://github.com/andeek/protoshiny  
https://github.com/jacobbien/protoclust


Goal: a tool to render hierarchical clustering useful again for exploring data sets at scales of interest

Hierarchical clustering represented by a dendrogram, which displays the original observations as leaves of a tree, with interior nodes of the tree corresponding to successive "mergings" of these observations into ever larger clusters

1. Use cluster prototypes to summarize branches of a dendrogram

1. Make dendrograms interactive

1. Help the user identify the interesting structures by suggesting adaptive cuts of the dendrogram.

**Interactive elements:** Searching, zooming, expansion and contraction of branches, label selection, initialization

# Shiny

Authors: Winston Chang, Joe Cheng, JJ Allaire, Yihui Xie, Jonathan McPherson

https://shiny.rstudio.com  
https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/cheatsheet.html

`R` package from RStudio that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from `R`

Default methods to build user interface elements in HTML and a handle to the server side code

Shiny functionality used in examples to create user controls, pass correctly formatted data to the client, and as a means to display summary information regarding the user's interactions 

Composed of two parts:

1. `server.R` -  What's going on under the hood
2. `ui.R` - What the user sees and touches

# D3

Authors: Mike Bostock

http://www.d3js.org

D3 "Data Driven Documents" is a JavaScript library for visualizing and interacting with data in a web-based interface

Facilitates manipulation of HTML elements, SVG (scalable vector graphics), and CSS (cascading style sheets) to render animations and provide user interactions that are tied to the underlying data

Document Object Model elements are completely determined by the data

Users to see and interact with graphical representations of their data in a web framework
